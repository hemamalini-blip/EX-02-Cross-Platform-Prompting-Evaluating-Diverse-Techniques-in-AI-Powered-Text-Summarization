## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
 Final Prompt

**Step 1:**
Summarize the following 500-word article on *“The Basics of Blockchain Technology”* in **120–150 words**. The summary should be **clear, structured, and beginner-friendly**, suitable for undergraduate students who may not have prior exposure to blockchain. Use **simple technical language** to explain the concept while maintaining accuracy.

**Step 2 (Feedback):**
Revise the summary to make it **even simpler and more engaging**. Include at least **two real-world examples** of blockchain applications (e.g., **cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin** and **supply chain tracking systems**). Ensure that the explanation highlights the **definition, working principles, key features, and advantages** of blockchain in a concise way.

**Additional Requirements:**

* Create a **mind map** of the key concepts of blockchain technology, covering:

  * Definition
  * Working Principles
  * Features (decentralization, security, transparency, immutability)
  * Applications (finance, healthcare, supply chain, voting systems, etc.)
* Generate at least **two high-quality images** that visually explain:

  1. How blockchain works (block structure, linking with cryptographic hash, distributed ledger).
  2. Real-world applications of blockchain in different industries.

**Dynamic Style Guidance:**

* Present the content in a **step-by-step, engaging, and technical yet beginner-friendly manner**.
* Use **short paragraphs, clear flow, and logical connections** between concepts.
* Highlight blockchain’s **impact, limitations, and future potential** to give students a **dynamic understanding** of the topic.

## Algorithm

## Result
Step 1 – Summary (120–150 words, clear & beginner-friendly)

Blockchain technology is a digital system used to record, verify, and store transactions securely. Instead of relying on one central authority, it works on a decentralized network of computers (nodes) where every transaction is grouped into a “block.” Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes, forming a chain that is nearly impossible to alter. This structure makes blockchain transparent, secure, and tamper-resistant.

Key features include decentralization (no single owner), immutability (data cannot be changed once stored), transparency (everyone can view transactions), and security (protected through encryption). Blockchain is widely used in financial transactions, supply chain management, and healthcare record systems.

Although it provides benefits like reduced fraud, efficiency, and cost savings, it also faces challenges such as energy consumption, scalability issues, and regulatory uncertainties. Still, blockchain holds great promise for reshaping digital trust and data management.

Step 2 – Revised Simpler Version with Real-World Examples

Blockchain is like a digital notebook that is shared by many computers around the world. Instead of one company controlling it, everyone in the network helps check and confirm the information. Once data is written in this notebook (a “block”), it is locked and connected to the previous block, making a secure “chain.”

This system is decentralized (no single controller), transparent (everyone can see records), and secure (hard to hack). For example, in Bitcoin, blockchain records who owns and transfers money without needing a bank. In the supply chain, companies like Walmart use it to track food from farms to stores, ensuring safety and trust.

Blockchain reduces fraud, lowers costs, and speeds up processes. But it also uses a lot of energy and struggles with handling huge amounts of data. Despite these challenges, it is becoming a powerful tool for finance, healthcare, voting, and more.
